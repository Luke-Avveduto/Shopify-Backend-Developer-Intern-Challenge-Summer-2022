# Shopify-Backend-Developer-Intern-Challenge-Summer-2022
This is my sumbission for the Shopify Backend Developer Intern Challenge for summer 2022. The project is built using java 12. 

# Setup Instructions
To run this program, the easist way to run the included jar file in out/artifacts/shopify_jar with java 12. 

If you do not already have java 12, you can find a download to the offical JDK here https://www.oracle.com/ca-en/java/technologies/javase/jdk12-archive-downloads.html. 

After you have done this, you can run the file in the command line with the following command while in the directory of the jar file, "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-12.0.2\bin\java" -jar shopify.jar


If you wish you may also clone the project and compile it yourself. While the project should complile with any version of Java above java 8, it has only be tested to work using java 12.
