# Shopify-Backend-Developer-Intern-Challenge-Summer-2022
This is my sumbission for the Shopify Backend Developer Intern Challenge for summer 2022. The project is built using java 11. 

# Setup Instructions
To run this program, the easiest way to clone the repo using Intellji. However, you can also clone and then just build the project using JDK 11 or just run the included Main.java with JDK 11 or newer on windows.
